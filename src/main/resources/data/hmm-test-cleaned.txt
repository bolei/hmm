WHAT A PITY IT IS ELINOR SAID MARIANNE THAT EDWARD SHOULD HAVE NO TASTE FOR DRAWING NO TASTE FOR DRAWING REPLIED ELINOR WHY SHOULD YOU THINK SO HE DOES NOT DRAW HIMSELF INDEED BUT HE HAS GREAT PLEASURE IN SEEING THE PERFORMANCES OF OTHER PEOPLE AND I ASSURE YOU HE IS BY NO MEANS DEFICIENT IN NATURAL TASTE THOUGH HE HAS NOT HAD OPPORTUNITIES OF IMPROVING IT HAD HE EVER BEEN IN THE WAY OF LEARNING I THINK HE WOULD HAVE DRAWN VERY WELL HE DISTRUSTS HIS OWN JUDGMENT IN SUCH MATTERS SO MUCH THAT HE IS ALWAYS UNWILLING TO GIVE HIS OPINION ON ANY PICTURE BUT HE HAS AN INNATE PROPRIETY AND SIMPLICITY OF TASTE WHICH IN GENERAL DIRECT HIM PERFECTLY RIGHT MARIANNE WAS AFRAID OF OFFENDING AND SAID NO MORE ON THE SUBJECT BUT THE KIND OF APPROBATION WHICH ELINOR DESCRIBED AS EXCITED IN HIM BY THE DRAWINGS OF OTHER PEOPLE WAS VERY FAR FROM THAT RAPTUROUS DELIGHT WHICH IN HER OPINION COULD ALONE BE CALLED TASTE YET THOUGH SMILING WITHIN HERSELF AT THE MISTAKE SHE HONOURED HER SISTER FOR THAT BLIND PARTIALITY TO EDWARD WHICH PRODUCED IT I HOPE MARIANNE CONTINUED ELINOR YOU DO NOT CONSIDER HIM AS DEFICIENT IN GENERAL TASTE INDEED I THINK I MAY SAY THAT YOU CANNOT FOR YOUR BEHAVIOUR TO HIM IS PERFECTLY CORDIAL AND IF THAT WERE YOUR OPINION I AM SURE YOU COULD NEVER BE CIVIL TO HIM MARIANNE HARDLY KNEW WHAT TO SAY SHE WOULD NOT WOUND THE FEELINGS OF HER SISTER ON ANY ACCOUNT AND YET TO SAY WHAT SHE DID NOT BELIEVE WAS IMPOSSIBLE AT LENGTH SHE REPLIED DO NOT BE OFFENDED ELINOR IF MY PRAISE OF HIM IS NOT IN EVERY THING EQUAL TO YOUR SENSE OF HIS MERITS I HAVE NOT HAD SO MANY OPPORTUNITIES OF ESTIMATING THE MINUTER PROPENSITIES OF HIS MIND HIS INCLINATIONS AND TASTES AS YOU HAVE BUT I HAVE THE HIGHEST OPINION IN THE WORLD OF HIS GOODNESS AND SENSE I THINK HIM EVERY THING THAT IS WORTHY AND AMIABLE I AM SURE REPLIED ELINOR WITH A SMILE THAT HIS DEAREST FRIENDS COULD NOT BE DISSATISFIED WITH SUCH COMMENDATION AS THAT I DO NOT PERCEIVE HOW YOU COULD EXPRESS YOURSELF MORE WARMLY MARIANNE WAS REJOICED TO FIND HER SISTER SO EASILY PLEASED OF HIS SENSE AND HIS GOODNESS CONTINUED ELINOR NO ONE CAN I THINK BE IN DOUBT WHO HAS SEEN HIM OFTEN ENOUGH TO ENGAGE HIM IN UNRESERVED CONVERSATION THE EXCELLENCE OF HIS UNDERSTANDING AND HIS PRINCIPLES CAN BE CONCEALED ONLY BY THAT SHYNESS WHICH TOO OFTEN KEEPS HIM SILENT YOU KNOW ENOUGH OF HIM TO DO JUSTICE TO HIS SOLID WORTH BUT OF HIS MINUTER PROPENSITIES AS YOU CALL THEM YOU HAVE FROM PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES BEEN KEPT MORE IGNORANT THAN MYSELF HE AND I HAVE BEEN AT TIMES THROWN A GOOD DEAL TOGETHER WHILE YOU HAVE BEEN WHOLLY ENGROSSED ON THE MOST AFFECTIONATE PRINCIPLE BY MY MOTHER I HAVE SEEN A GREAT DEAL OF HIM HAVE STUDIED HIS SENTIMENTS AND HEARD HIS OPINION ON SUBJECTS OF LITERATURE AND TASTE AND UPON THE WHOLE I VENTURE TO PRONOUNCE THAT HIS MIND IS WELL INFORMED ENJOYMENT OF BOOKS EXCEEDINGLY GREAT HIS IMAGINATION LIVELY HIS OBSERVATION JUST AND CORRECT AND HIS TASTE DELICATE AND PURE HIS ABILITIES IN EVERY RESPECT IMPROVE AS MUCH UPON ACQUAINTANCE AS HIS MANNERS AND PERSON AT FIRST SIGHT HIS ADDRESS IS CERTAINLY NOT STRIKING AND HIS PERSON CAN HARDLY BE CALLED HANDSOME TILL THE EXPRESSION OF HIS EYES WHICH ARE UNCOMMONLY GOOD AND THE GENERAL SWEETNESS OF HIS COUNTENANCE IS PERCEIVED AT PRESENT I KNOW HIM SO WELL THAT I THINK HIM REALLY HANDSOME OR AT LEAST ALMOST SO WHAT SAY YOU MARIANNE I SHALL VERY SOON THINK HIM HANDSOME ELINOR IF I DO NOT NOW WHEN YOU TELL ME TO LOVE HIM AS A BROTHER I SHALL NO MORE SEE IMPERFECTION IN HIS FACE THAN I NOW DO IN HIS HEART ELINOR STARTED AT THIS DECLARATION AND WAS SORRY FOR THE WARMTH SHE HAD BEEN BETRAYED INTO IN SPEAKING OF HIM SHE FELT THAT EDWARD STOOD VERY HIGH IN HER OPINION SHE BELIEVED THE REGARD TO BE MUTUAL BUT SHE REQUIRED GREATER CERTAINTY OF IT TO MAKE MARIANNE S CONVICTION OF THEIR ATTACHMENT AGREEABLE TO HER SHE KNEW THAT WHAT MARIANNE AND HER MOTHER CONJECTURED ONE MOMENT THEY BELIEVED THE NEXT THAT WITH THEM TO WISH WAS TO HOPE AND TO HOPE WAS TO EXPECT SHE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE REAL STATE OF THE CASE TO HER SISTER I DO NOT ATTEMPT TO DENY SAID SHE THAT I THINK VERY HIGHLY OF HIM THAT I GREATLY ESTEEM THAT I LIKE HIM MARIANNE HERE BURST FORTH WITH INDIGNATION ESTEEM HIM LIKE HIM COLD HEARTED ELINOR OH WORSE THAN COLD HEARTED ASHAMED OF BEING OTHERWISE USE THOSE WORDS AGAIN AND I WILL LEAVE THE ROOM THIS MOMENT ELINOR COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING EXCUSE ME SAID SHE AND BE ASSURED THAT I MEANT NO OFFENCE TO YOU BY SPEAKING IN SO QUIET A WAY OF MY OWN FEELINGS BELIEVE THEM TO BE STRONGER THAN I HAVE DECLARED BELIEVE THEM IN SHORT TO BE SUCH AS HIS MERIT AND THE SUSPICION THE HOPE OF HIS AFFECTION FOR ME MAY WARRANT WITHOUT IMPRUDENCE OR FOLLY BUT FARTHER THAN THIS YOU MUST NOT BELIEVE I AM BY NO MEANS ASSURED OF HIS REGARD FOR ME THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN THE EXTENT OF IT SEEMS DOUBTFUL AND TILL HIS SENTIMENTS ARE FULLY KNOWN YOU CANNOT WONDER AT MY WISHING TO AVOID ANY ENCOURAGEMENT OF MY OWN PARTIALITY BY BELIEVING OR CALLING IT MORE THAN IT IS IN MY HEART I FEEL LITTLE SCARCELY ANY DOUBT OF HIS PREFERENCE BUT THERE ARE OTHER POINTS TO BE CONSIDERED BESIDES HIS INCLINATION HE IS VERY FAR FROM BEING INDEPENDENT WHAT HIS MOTHER REALLY IS WE CANNOT KNOW BUT FROM FANNY S OCCASIONAL MENTION OF HER CONDUCT AND OPINIONS WE HAVE NEVER BEEN DISPOSED TO THINK HER AMIABLE AND I AM VERY MUCH MISTAKEN IF EDWARD IS NOT HIMSELF AWARE THAT THERE WOULD BE MANY DIFFICULTIES IN HIS WAY IF HE WERE TO WISH TO MARRY A WOMAN WHO HAD NOT EITHER A GREAT FORTUNE OR HIGH RANK MARIANNE WAS ASTONISHED TO FIND HOW MUCH THE IMAGINATION OF HER MOTHER AND HERSELF HAD OUTSTRIPPED THE TRUTH AND YOU REALLY ARE NOT ENGAGED TO HIM SAID SHE YET IT CERTAINLY SOON WILL HAPPEN BUT TWO ADVANTAGES WILL PROCEED FROM THIS DELAY I SHALL NOT LOSE YOU SO SOON AND EDWARD WILL HAVE GREATER OPPORTUNITY OF IMPROVING THAT NATURAL TASTE FOR YOUR FAVOURITE PURSUIT WHICH MUST BE SO INDISPENSABLY NECESSARY TO YOUR FUTURE FELICITY OH IF HE SHOULD BE SO FAR STIMULATED BY YOUR GENIUS AS TO LEARN TO DRAW HIMSELF HOW DELIGHTFUL IT WOULD BE ELINOR HAD GIVEN HER REAL OPINION TO HER SISTER SHE COULD NOT CONSIDER HER PARTIALITY FOR EDWARD IN SO PROSPEROUS A STATE AS MARIANNE HAD BELIEVED IT THERE WAS AT TIMES A WANT OF SPIRITS ABOUT HIM WHICH IF IT DID NOT DENOTE INDIFFERENCE SPOKE OF SOMETHING ALMOST AS UNPROMISING A DOUBT OF HER REGARD SUPPOSING HIM TO FEEL IT NEED NOT GIVE HIM MORE THAN INQUIETUDE IT WOULD NOT BE LIKELY TO PRODUCE THAT DEJECTION OF MIND WHICH FREQUENTLY ATTENDED HIM A MORE REASONABLE CAUSE MIGHT BE FOUND IN THE DEPENDENT SITUATION WHICH FORBADE THE INDULGENCE OF HIS AFFECTION SHE KNEW THAT HIS MOTHER NEITHER BEHAVED TO HIM SO AS TO MAKE HIS HOME COMFORTABLE AT PRESENT NOR TO GIVE HIM ANY ASSURANCE THAT HE MIGHT FORM A HOME FOR HIMSELF WITHOUT STRICTLY ATTENDING TO HER VIEWS FOR HIS AGGRANDIZEMENT WITH SUCH A KNOWLEDGE AS THIS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ELINOR TO FEEL EASY ON THE SUBJECT SHE WAS FAR FROM DEPENDING ON THAT RESULT OF HIS PREFERENCE OF HER WHICH HER MOTHER AND SISTER STILL CONSIDERED AS CERTAIN NAY THE LONGER THEY WERE TOGETHER THE MORE DOUBTFUL SEEMED THE NATURE OF HIS REGARD AND SOMETIMES FOR A FEW PAINFUL MINUTES SHE BELIEVED IT TO BE NO MORE THAN FRIENDSHIP BUT WHATEVER MIGHT REALLY BE ITS LIMITS IT WAS ENOUGH WHEN PERCEIVED BY HIS SISTER TO MAKE HER UNEASY AND AT THE SAME TIME WHICH WAS STILL MORE COMMON TO MAKE HER UNCIVIL SHE TOOK THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY OF AFFRONTING HER MOTHER IN LAW ON THE OCCASION TALKING TO HER SO EXPRESSIVELY OF HER BROTHER S GREAT EXPECTATIONS OF MRS FERRARS S RESOLUTION THAT BOTH HER SONS SHOULD MARRY WELL AND OF THE DANGER ATTENDING ANY YOUNG WOMAN WHO ATTEMPTED TO DRAW HIM IN THAT MRS DASHWOOD COULD NEITHER PRETEND TO BE UNCONSCIOUS NOR ENDEAVOR TO BE CALM SHE GAVE HER AN ANSWER WHICH MARKED HER CONTEMPT AND INSTANTLY LEFT THE ROOM RESOLVING THAT WHATEVER MIGHT BE THE INCONVENIENCE OR EXPENSE OF SO SUDDEN A REMOVAL HER BELOVED ELINOR SHOULD NOT BE EXPOSED ANOTHER WEEK TO SUCH INSINUATIONS IN THIS STATE OF HER SPIRITS A LETTER WAS DELIVERED TO HER FROM THE POST WHICH CONTAINED A PROPOSAL PARTICULARLY WELL TIMED IT WAS THE OFFER OF A SMALL HOUSE ON VERY EASY TERMS BELONGING TO A RELATION OF HER OWN A GENTLEMAN OF CONSEQUENCE AND PROPERTY IN DEVONSHIRE THE LETTER WAS FROM THIS GENTLEMAN HIMSELF AND WRITTEN IN THE TRUE SPIRIT OF FRIENDLY ACCOMMODATION HE UNDERSTOOD THAT SHE WAS IN NEED OF A DWELLING AND THOUGH THE HOUSE HE NOW OFFERED HER WAS MERELY A COTTAGE HE ASSURED HER THAT EVERYTHING SHOULD BE DONE TO IT WHICH SHE MIGHT THINK NECESSARY IF THE SITUATION PLEASED HER HE EARNESTLY PRESSED HER AFTER GIVING THE PARTICULARS OF THE HOUSE AND GARDEN TO COME WITH HER DAUGHTERS TO BARTON PARK THE PLACE OF HIS OWN RESIDENCE FROM WHENCE SHE MIGHT JUDGE HERSELF WHETHER BARTON COTTAGE FOR THE HOUSES WERE IN THE SAME PARISH COULD BY ANY ALTERATION BE MADE COMFORTABLE TO HER HE SEEMED REALLY ANXIOUS TO ACCOMMODATE THEM AND THE WHOLE OF HIS LETTER WAS WRITTEN IN SO FRIENDLY A STYLE AS COULD NOT FAIL OF GIVING PLEASURE TO HIS COUSIN MORE ESPECIALLY AT A MOMENT WHEN SHE WAS SUFFERING UNDER THE COLD AND UNFEELING BEHAVIOUR OF HER NEARER CONNECTIONS SHE NEEDED NO TIME FOR DELIBERATION OR INQUIRY HER RESOLUTION WAS FORMED AS SHE READ THE SITUATION OF BARTON IN A COUNTY SO FAR DISTANT FROM SUSSEX AS DEVONSHIRE WHICH BUT A FEW HOURS BEFORE WOULD HAVE BEEN A SUFFICIENT OBJECTION TO OUTWEIGH EVERY POSSIBLE ADVANTAGE BELONGING TO THE PLACE WAS NOW ITS FIRST RECOMMENDATION TO QUIT THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF NORLAND WAS NO LONGER AN EVIL IT WAS AN OBJECT OF DESIRE IT WAS A BLESSING IN COMPARISON OF THE MISERY OF CONTINUING HER DAUGHTER IN LAW S GUEST AND TO REMOVE FOR EVER FROM THAT BELOVED PLACE WOULD BE LESS PAINFUL THAN TO INHABIT OR VISIT IT WHILE SUCH A WOMAN WAS ITS MISTRESS SHE INSTANTLY WROTE SIR JOHN MIDDLETON HER ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF HIS KINDNESS AND HER ACCEPTANCE OF HIS PROPOSAL AND THEN HASTENED TO SHEW BOTH LETTERS TO HER DAUGHTERS THAT SHE MIGHT BE SECURE OF THEIR APPROBATION BEFORE HER ANSWER WERE SENT ELINOR HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WOULD BE MORE PRUDENT FOR THEM TO SETTLE AT SOME DISTANCE FROM NORLAND THAN IMMEDIATELY AMONGST THEIR PRESENT ACQUAINTANCE ON THAT HEAD THEREFORE IT WAS NOT FOR HER TO OPPOSE HER MOTHER S INTENTION OF REMOVING INTO DEVONSHIRE THE HOUSE TOO AS DESCRIBED BY SIR JOHN WAS ON SO SIMPLE A SCALE AND THE RENT SO UNCOMMONLY MODERATE AS TO LEAVE HER NO RIGHT OF OBJECTION ON EITHER POINT AND THEREFORE THOUGH IT WAS NOT A PLAN WHICH BROUGHT ANY CHARM TO HER FANCY THOUGH IT WAS A REMOVAL FROM THE VICINITY OF NORLAND BEYOND HER WISHES SHE MADE NO ATTEMPT TO DISSUADE HER MOTHER FROM SENDING A LETTER OF ACQUIESCENCE NO SOONER WAS HER ANSWER DISPATCHED THAN MRS DASHWOOD INDULGED HERSELF IN THE PLEASURE OF ANNOUNCING TO HER SON IN LAW AND HIS WIFE THAT SHE WAS PROVIDED WITH A HOUSE AND SHOULD INCOMMODE THEM NO LONGER THAN TILL EVERY THING WERE READY FOR HER INHABITING IT THEY HEARD HER WITH SURPRISE MRS JOHN DASHWOOD SAID NOTHING BUT HER HUSBAND CIVILLY HOPED THAT SHE WOULD NOT BE SETTLED FAR FROM NORLAND SHE HAD GREAT SATISFACTION IN REPLYING THAT SHE WAS GOING INTO DEVONSHIRE EDWARD TURNED HASTILY TOWARDS HER ON HEARING THIS AND IN A VOICE OF SURPRISE AND CONCERN WHICH REQUIRED NO EXPLANATION TO HER REPEATED DEVONSHIRE ARE YOU INDEED GOING THERE SO FAR FROM HENCE AND TO WHAT PART OF IT SHE EXPLAINED THE SITUATION IT WAS WITHIN FOUR MILES NORTHWARD OF EXETER IT IS BUT A COTTAGE SHE CONTINUED BUT I HOPE TO SEE MANY OF MY FRIENDS IN IT A ROOM OR TWO CAN EASILY BE ADDED AND IF MY FRIENDS FIND NO DIFFICULTY IN TRAVELLING SO FAR TO SEE ME I AM SURE I WILL FIND NONE IN ACCOMMODATING THEM SHE CONCLUDED WITH A VERY KIND INVITATION TO MR AND MRS JOHN DASHWOOD TO VISIT HER AT BARTON AND TO EDWARD SHE GAVE ONE WITH STILL GREATER AFFECTION THOUGH HER LATE CONVERSATION WITH HER DAUGHTER IN LAW HAD MADE HER RESOLVE ON REMAINING AT NORLAND NO LONGER THAN WAS UNAVOIDABLE IT HAD NOT PRODUCED THE SMALLEST EFFECT ON HER IN THAT POINT TO WHICH IT PRINCIPALLY TENDED TO SEPARATE EDWARD AND ELINOR WAS AS FAR FROM BEING HER OBJECT AS EVER AND SHE WISHED TO SHOW MRS JOHN DASHWOOD BY THIS POINTED INVITATION TO HER BROTHER HOW TOTALLY SHE DISREGARDED HER DISAPPROBATION OF THE MATCH MR JOHN DASHWOOD TOLD HIS MOTHER AGAIN AND AGAIN HOW EXCEEDINGLY SORRY HE WAS THAT SHE HAD TAKEN A HOUSE AT SUCH A DISTANCE FROM NORLAND AS TO PREVENT HIS BEING OF ANY SERVICE TO HER IN REMOVING HER FURNITURE HE REALLY FELT CONSCIENTIOUSLY VEXED ON THE OCCASION FOR THE VERY EXERTION TO WHICH HE HAD LIMITED THE PERFORMANCE OF HIS PROMISE TO HIS FATHER WAS BY THIS ARRANGEMENT RENDERED IMPRACTICABLE THE FURNITURE WAS ALL SENT AROUND BY WATER IT CHIEFLY CONSISTED OF HOUSEHOLD LINEN PLATE CHINA AND BOOKS WITH A HANDSOME PIANOFORTE OF MARIANNE S MRS JOHN DASHWOOD SAW THE PACKAGES DEPART WITH A SIGH SHE COULD NOT HELP FEELING IT HARD THAT AS MRS DASHWOOD S INCOME WOULD BE SO TRIFLING IN COMPARISON WITH THEIR OWN SHE SHOULD HAVE ANY HANDSOME ARTICLE OF FURNITURE MRS DASHWOOD TOOK THE HOUSE FOR A TWELVEMONTH IT WAS READY FURNISHED AND SHE MIGHT HAVE IMMEDIATE POSSESSION NO DIFFICULTY AROSE ON EITHER SIDE IN THE AGREEMENT AND SHE WAITED ONLY FOR THE DISPOSAL OF HER EFFECTS AT NORLAND AND TO DETERMINE HER FUTURE HOUSEHOLD BEFORE SHE SET OFF FOR THE WEST AND THIS AS SHE WAS EXCEEDINGLY RAPID IN THE PERFORMANCE OF EVERYTHING THAT INTERESTED HER WAS SOON DONE THE HORSES WHICH WERE LEFT HER BY HER HUSBAND HAD BEEN SOLD SOON AFTER HIS DEATH AND AN OPPORTUNITY NOW OFFERING OF DISPOSING OF HER CARRIAGE SHE AGREED TO SELL THAT LIKEWISE AT THE EARNEST ADVICE OF HER ELDEST DAUGHTER FOR THE COMFORT OF HER CHILDREN HAD SHE CONSULTED ONLY HER OWN WISHES SHE WOULD HAVE KEPT IT BUT THE DISCRETION OF ELINOR PREVAILED HER WISDOM TOO LIMITED THE NUMBER OF THEIR SERVANTS TO THREE TWO MAIDS AND A MAN WITH WHOM THEY WERE SPEEDILY PROVIDED FROM AMONGST THOSE WHO HAD FORMED THEIR ESTABLISHMENT AT NORLAND
